# Cdce913Programmer
TI CDCE913 Programmable 1-PLL VCXO clock synthesizer chip programmer

Transfers the Intel hex file generated by the TI ClockPro software using a RS232 terminal emulator, e.g., Teraterm to the CDCE913 chip via i2c.

Steps required:
1. Compile and upload the program Cdce913Programmer.ino to a 3.3 V arduino board (e.g., MKRZERO, PI PICO, etc.)
3. Generate the intel hex file with ClockPro https://www.ti.com/tool/de-de/CLOCKPRO#downloads
4. Store file on your PC
5. Connect the CDCE913 hardware to the arduino board via i2c
6. Connect the arduino board to your PC
7. Open Teraterm or an other terminal program, open serial port, baudrate = 9600
8. Type H to list the available commands
9. To program the chip:
   - type E to erase the EEPROM of the CDCE913
   - type F, then transfer the the intel hex file using the commands  File -> Send File to the internal memory of the programmer
   - type W to write to the EEPROM of the CDCE913

Using the E, R and W commands it is possible to make a copy of an previously programmed chip
